# IDMYBIRD

s a web application that allows users ti identify bird species by uploading an image. Powered by a FASTAPI backend and a machine learning model that can acurtaly predcit up to 200 diffrent bird spicies at 80% accuracy. The Front End is built with React.JS


Features:
Image Upload: users can upload images and recvive a prediction along with a confidence score

Responsive Design: The Front End is built with React.JS tied to a FASTAPI python backend for fast preformance
